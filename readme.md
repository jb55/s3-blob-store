## Installation

  Install with npm

## Example

```js
var aws = require('aws-sdk');
var s3blobs = require('s3-blob-store');

var client = new aws.S3({
  accessKeyId: process.env.S3_ACCESS_KEY,
  secretAccessKey: process.env.S3_SECRET_KEY
})

var store = s3blobs({
  client: client,
  bucket: 'mybucket'
});


// write to s3
fs.createReadStream('/tmp/somefile.txt')
  .pipe(store.createWriteStream({ key: 'somefile.txt' }))


// read from s3
var readStream = store.createReadStream({ key: 'somefile.txt' });
/*
For range requests:
var readStream = store.createReadStream({
  key: 'somefile.txt',
  range: { start: 20, end: 40 }
});
*/

readStream.on('error', function(err){
  if (err.code === 'NoSuchKey') {
    console.error('key does not exist');
  }
});

readStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('/tmp/somefile.txt'))


// exists
store.exists({ key: 'somefile.txt' }, function(err, exists){
})
```

## API

### var s3 = require('s3-blob-store')(options)

`options` must be an object that has the following properties:

`client`: an `require('aws-sdk').S3` instance
`bucket`: your bucket

### s3.createWriteStream(opts, cb)

returns a writable stream that you can pipe data to.

`opts` should be an object that has options `key` (will be the filename in
your bucket)

`opts.params` additional [parameters](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#putObject-property) to pass to S3

`cb` will be called with `(err)` if there is was an error

### s3.createReadStream(opts)

opts should be `{key: string (usually a hash or path + filename}`

`opts.params` additional [parameters](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#getObject-property) to pass to S3

returns a readable stream of data for the file in your bucket whose key matches
