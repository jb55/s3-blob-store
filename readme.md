## Installation

Install with npm

    $ npm install s3-blob-store

## Example

```js
var aws = require('aws-sdk');
var s3blobs = require('s3-blob-store');

var client = new aws.S3({
  accessKeyId: process.env.S3_ACCESS_KEY,
  secretAccessKey: process.env.S3_SECRET_KEY
});

var store = s3blobs({
  client: client,
  bucket: 'mybucket'
});

// write to s3
fs.createReadStream('/tmp/somefile.txt')
  .pipe(store.createWriteStream({ key: 'somefile.txt' }));

// read from s3
store.createReadStream({ key: 'somefile.txt' })
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('/tmp/somefile.txt'));

// exists
store.exists({ key: 'somefile.txt' }, function (err, exists) {
  // ...
});
```

## API

### `var s3 = require('s3-blob-store')(options)`

`options` must be an object that has the following properties:

- `client`: an `require('aws-sdk').S3` instance
- `bucket`: your bucket

### `s3.createWriteStream(opts, cb)`

returns a writable stream that you can pipe data to.

`opts` should be an object that has options `key` (will be the filename in
your bucket)

`opts.params` additional [parameters](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#putObject-property) to pass to S3

`cb` will be called with `(err)` if there is was an error

### `s3.createReadStream(opts)`

`opts` should be `{ key: string (usually a hash or path + filename) }`

`opts.params` additional [parameters](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#getObject-property) to pass to S3
`opts.concurrency` optional parameter for [s3-download-stream](https://github.com/jb55/s3-download-stream)
`opts.chunkSize` optional parameter for [s3-download-stream](https://github.com/jb55/s3-download-stream)

returns a readable stream of data for the file in your bucket whose key matches
